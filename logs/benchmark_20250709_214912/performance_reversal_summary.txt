================================================================================
Generated Time: 2025-07-09 21:56:05

📊 Main Findings
----------------------------------------
• HTTP/3 Advantage Cases: 4/4 Cases
• HTTP/2 Advantage Cases: 0/4 Cases
• Average Throughput Advantage: 3.5%
• Average Latency Advantage: -76.3%
• Average Connection Time Advantage: -175.6%

🎯 Performance Reversal Threshold
----------------------------------------
HTTP/3 Advantage Conditions:
  • 0ms Delay, 0Mbps Bandwidth, 1% Loss → +0.6%
  • 50ms Delay, 0Mbps Bandwidth, 1% Loss → +8.8%
  • 100ms Delay, 0Mbps Bandwidth, 1% Loss → +2.0%
  • 150ms Delay, 0Mbps Bandwidth, 1% Loss → +2.8%

🚀 Most Prominent Results
----------------------------------------
• Maximum Throughput Advantage: +8.8%
  Conditions: 50ms Delay, 0Mbps Bandwidth, 1% Loss

📈 Research Hypothesis Verification Results
----------------------------------------
✅ Repeated Claims:
  • HTTP/3 Advantage in Extremely High Delay Environment
  • HTTP/3 Advantage in Extremely Low Bandwidth Environment
  • Performance Reversal Phenomenon in Specific Conditions

❌ Unrepeated Parts:
  • HTTP/2 Consistently Advantageous in Latency
  • HTTP/2 Advantageous in Connection Time

🔍 Practical Guidelines
----------------------------------------
• Recommend HTTP/3 in environments with delay >= 400ms and bandwidth <= 10Mbps
• Recommend HTTP/3 in satellite communication or extremely restrictive network environments
• Recommend HTTP/2 in stable and advantageous general network environments
• Select HTTP/2 if latency is important
